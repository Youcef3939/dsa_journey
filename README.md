welcome to my **data structures and algorithms (DSA)** journey!  
this repository documents my daily progress solving algorithmic problems from platforms like **HackerRank**, **Codewars**, **Exercism**, and other free LeetCode alternatives

---

## ðŸš€ goals
- strengthen my **problem-solving** and **analytical thinking** skills
- improve fluency in **Python** through consistent practice
- solve **at least one problem per day** and push it to GitHub  
- build a **public record** of consistency and growth
