Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** journey!  
This repository documents my daily progress solving algorithmic problems from platforms like **HackerRank**, **Codewars**, **Exercism**, and other free LeetCode alternatives.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Strengthen my **problem-solving** and **analytical thinking** skills
- Improve fluency in **Python** through consistent practice
- Solve **at least one problem per day** and push it to GitHub  
- Build a **public record** of consistency and growth
